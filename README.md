- ⚡ Fun fact:@Did you know that the first computer "bug"
- was literally a bug? In 1947, when the Harvard Mark II
- computer malfunctioned, engineers discovered a moth stuck
-  in one of its relays. They taped the moth into their logbook
-  with the notation: "First actual case of bug being found.
-  " This incident led to the coining of the term "debugging" for
-   fixing computer glitches.
